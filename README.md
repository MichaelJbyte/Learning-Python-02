# Learning-Python-02
Learning python through a full course tutorial. [9/9/25 - Present]

This repository will document the process of my python learning through the use of a full course available [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0) on YouTube.  
Below will hold my notes taken for each day and will contain any code I type alongside the course.

## Day 1 [9/9/25]

Today's lesson is review on variables, typecasting, and user input. I end by performing multiple exercises regarding these topics.

### Code Used: [Review01.py](Review01.py)

### Notes:

N/A. All review.

## Day 2 [9/11/25]

Today I practiced with arithmetic and math functions, if statements, and user inputs. I also learned more about conditional expressions. I performed a variety of exercises surrounding these topics.

### Code Used: [Review02.py](Review02.py)

### Notes:

* Make sure to properly order your if statements to prevent overlapping statements.
* When using an if statement and a boolean together, you do not need to write a condition for the boolean.
* When creating a condition to test if an interger is between two others, you write it like this: '12 > x > 5'

## Day 3 [9/16/25]

Today I learned about frequently used string methods along with string indexing. I also learned about multiple formatting flags. Lastly I reviewed and practiced with while loops. I used all of this newfound knowledge to create a compound interest calculator.

### Code Used: [Lesson01.py](Lesson01.py)

### Notes:

N/A.

## Day 4 [9/18/25]

Today I reviewed for loops and nested loops. I also learned about the differences and uses of lists, tuples, and sets. I performed a couple of exercises regarding these topics.

### Code Used: [Lesson02.py](Lesson02.py)

### Notes:

* the 'dir()' function allows you to look at attributes of lists.
* the 'help()' function is just like '--help' for Linux.
