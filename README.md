# Learning-Python-02
Learning python through a full course tutorial. [9/9/25 - Present]

This repository will document the process of my python learning through the use of a full course available [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0) on YouTube.  
Below will hold my notes taken for each day and will contain any code I type alongside the course.

## Day 1 [9/9/25]

Today's lesson is review on variables, typecasting, and user input. I end by performing multiple exercises regarding these topics.

### Code Used: [Review01.py](Review01.py)

### Notes:

N/A. All review.

## Day 2 [9/11/25]

Today I practiced with arithmetic and math functions, if statements, and user inputs. I also learned more about conditional expressions. I performed a variety of exercises surrounding these topics.

### Code Used: [Review02.py](Review02.py)

### Notes:

* Make sure to properly order your if statements to prevent overlapping statements.
* When using an if statement and a boolean together, you do not need to write a condition for the boolean.
* When creating a condition to test if an interger is between two others, you write it like this: '12 > x > 5'
